<b>Analysis of the origin of SARS-COV 2, how could this pandemic have started?</b><br><br>
On December 31, 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown etiology was detected in the city of Wuhan (China). A week later, a new coronavirus was isolated from these patients, initially designated as 2019-nCoV and later as SARS-CoV-2. This is a new virus that is much closer genetically to bat coronaviruses than to human SARS. By applying crucial engineering resources (such as: the Needleman-Wunsch genetic sequence alignment algorithm, the use of the PAM250 array, and the involvement of the Levenshtein distance algorithm), it was possible to compare various viruses from which SARS-COV 2 was believed to be derived. After the conclusions of this investigation, there is no doubt that RaTG13 is related to SARS-COV 2, this is a considerable milestone to decipher the phylogenetic tree that represents this newly discovered virus.
